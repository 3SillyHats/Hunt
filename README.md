The hunter becomes the hunted in a fast paced local multiplayer chase game.

Instructions
============

Every ten seconds one player will be selected to be the hunter (indicated by their character turning red). They must then attempt to catch as many of the other players as they can before the time runs out and a new hunter is selected. First player to ten catches wins.

To play you need two to four players each with a gamepad.

Controls:
---------
 - Left joystick (axis 1): Move
 - A button: Boost
 - B button: Dodge

Press A to boost in the direction you are currently moving. Press B as the hunted to dodge, stopping instantly and becoming temporarily invulnerable.
