The hunter becomes the hunted in a fast paced local multiplayer chase game.

To play you need two to four players each with a gamepad.

Controls:
- Left joystick (axis 1): Move/aim boost
- A button: Use boost

Hold down A while aiming the boost, then let go to fire. Boosting in no direction stops you instantly and makes you invulnerable for a short time.
